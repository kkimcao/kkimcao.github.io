		<h3>Personal Information</h3>
		<p>
		My name is Kim Cao. I am a second-year student studying at RMIT university. I have completed VCE in 2016 and I am now currently studying an Associate Degree in Information Technology.
		I am Australian born but my ethnicity is Vietnamese, therefore I can speak Vietnamese fluently. </p>
		<p>
		My interests involve spending time with my family and friends but especially with pet dog, Maples. I also enjoy doing physical activity likes sports. Outside of university, I have a netball team that I play with my friends every Tuesday night. Majority of my daily life would be working, I have a part-time job at Commonwealth Bank where I work in the call centre department.

		</p>
		
		<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
		<p>
		At this current moment, my interest in IT involve learning the different coding languages behind programs or troubleshooting technical issues.
		My interest in IT began when I was quite young, when I would have IT class in school or playing computer games with my older brothers. In addition, when teachers had problems with their computer, often I would be the one that was able to troubleshoot and fix the issue. </p>
		<p>
		A person that sparked my interest in IT, was my dad who was a very tech-savvy person. Whenever I had issues with my computer, he was always able to fix it and as a result, it had me very intrigued with what he did and how he did it. It was from there, that I began to troubleshoot my own problems and play around with technology. I have not necessarily worked in an IT based job, but at this current moment I am exploring my options to see what there is to offer.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		During my studies at RMIT, I am expecting to learn different aspects of IT. I am expecting to learn different languages of programs, learning how to work in a team environment to develop ideas and to learn about different technical systems and programs.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
		<p1>My ideal job would be some where along the lines of assisting people with the use of technology or trouble shooting technical problems for customers.</p1>
		
		<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
		<h4>Myers-Briggs Test</h4>
		<p>
		The result of the Myers-Briggs test showed that I am a protagonist. It implies that I am the type of person that enjoys working in a team environment but also one to lead a team. From these results, it </p>
		<h4>Learning style test</h4>
		<p>
		The results of a learning style test showed that I am a kinesthetic-tactile learner. This means that I learn best when  I am physically engaged during the learning process.

		<h3>Project ideas</h3>
		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>The ultimate goal of this project is to create an attachment for a pair of glasses that utilises sensors. The sensors mounted will measure the distance from the user themselves, to an obstruction. When the user reaches a certain distance to an obstruction, the glasses will vibrate at a certain intensity (depending on the distance) signalling a hazard to the user. The closer the distance the stronger the strength of the vibration. This will enable the users to gain more spatial awareness and a better grasp of their surroundings/area. Ultimately, this system in turn will reduce risks and hazards associated that can endanger human life. </p>
		
		<h4>Motivation</h4>
		<p>This product is intentionally built to aid the vision-impaired people, in the efforts of adding an extra layer of protection against risk, hazards and injuries. The significance of the glasses will be to provide vision-impaired people with better sense of their surroundings when getting around on foot. A survey of 607 blind and vision-impaired people was conducted about their experiences as pedestrians, showcased that 1 in 12 Victorians have been hit by a vehicle or bicycle while walking in the past 5 years. Using this product will provide the user vital information of the their surrounding at hand, which is one step to closer to reducing further risks.  </p>
		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p>The product can precisely detect things incoming that is within its range. The sensor assures the user that the distance to nearby obstacles is measured, regards of the transparency or lighting conditions of an object. The information collected is relayed to the user instantly through intuitive vibrations.</p>

		<p>The plastic frame design is made to extend the durability of the product for different environment conditions. In addition, it protects the sensitive parts but also it is easily accessible for replacement or maintenance. It is also water resistant and can function in light - moderate rain.</p>

		<p>The product includes a selection of two different ranges of detection; a 1 metre range or a 2 metre range. The option to toggle between the two different range is just with a click of a button.</p>

		<p>The sensor will be a crucial component of the product which will detect and record the ambient distance in the surrounding vicinity. The sensors can detect high objects a cane nor a guide dog can warn against. It works by detecting obstacles in front of users at head level, then measuring the distance between the user and the obstacle itself. </p>

		<p>In conjunction with the sensor is a small vibrating component, which will be attached in the product itself. The operation of the vibrating is fairly simple, once a obstacle has been detected, the user can be alerted through intuitive vibrations, notifying the person to safely move around any objects they may encounter. </p>

		<p>The vibrating component works together with the sensor, emitting instant alerts in cooperation of the sensor itself. The closer the detected distance of the object results into a greater strength output of the vibration. The intensity and frequency of the vibrations increase when the obstacle is approached closer to the person and vice versa. Within an armâ€™s length, quicker and faster vibrations emit alerting the user to stop.  </p>


		<p>The product is rechargeable and can last up to 10 hours when fully charged. The device can be charged using any standard Micro-USB cable. Users will be alerted of the battery level through certain vibrations, once turned on:
		<ul>
				<li>1 vibration indicates that the battery level is lower than 25%</li>
				<li>2 vibration indicates that the battery level is between 25%-50%</li>
				<li>3 vibration indicates that the battery level is between 50%-75%</li>
				<li>4 vibration indicates that the battery level is above 75%</li>
			  </ul> 

		</p>
		<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
		<p>The design of the product includes tinted lens, plastic frames, rechargeable battery to power the device, a button attached to toggle between ranging modes, sensors for detection and measuring distance of obstacles and a vibrating component that will be attached in the glasses. The components of the product are small and compact so that it is light enough to be mounted on the glasses. </p>
		<p>
		The sensors will be initially calibrated with the vibrator to transmit an accurate alert and visual representation for the user of their surroundings. This can be achieved by using a program to code the measurements and calibrate the connection between the sensors and the vibrating device.		
 </p>
		<h4>Skills Required</h4>
		<p>Coding/programming skills are required to calibrate the sensor with the vibrating component that emits vibration at a specific intensity when reaching a specific distance. In addition, an electrical engineer will be required for circuitry and wiring of different components to make up the device to cooperate with each other. The hardware components itself are quite simple and easy to obtain, however the production of the coding may be a drawback.  </p>
		<h4>Outcome</h4>
		<p>If the project is successful, this will be very beneficial to the vision-impaired. It will largely reduce the risks and hazards vision-impaired people encounter every day, protecting them against any physical injury. This development can improve the confidence, the independence and the overall quality of life for those living with blindness or vision loss. </p>
