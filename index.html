		<h2>Personal Information</h2>
		<p1>
		My name is Kim Cao. I am a second-year student studying at RMIT university. I have completed VCE in 2016 and I am now currently studying an Associate Degree in Information Technology.
		I am Australian born but my ethnicity is Vietnamese, therefore I can speak Vietnamese fluently. My interests involve spending time with my family and friends but especially with pet dog, Maples. I also enjoy doing physical activity likes sports. Outside of university, I have a netball team that I play with my friends every Tuesday night. Majority of my daily life would be working, I have a part-time job at Commonwealth Bank where I work in the call centre department.

		<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
		<p1>
		
		At this current moment, my interest in IT involve learning the different coding languages behind programs or troubleshooting technical issues. My interest in IT began when I was quite young, when I would have IT class in school or playing computer games with my older brothers. In addition, when teachers had problems with their computer, often I would be the one that was able to troubleshoot and fix the issue. A person that sparked my interest in IT, was my dad. My dad is very tech-savvy, whenever I had issues with my computer, he was always able to fix it, as a result, it had me very intrigued with how he did things. It was from there where I begun to troubleshoot my own problems and play around with technology. I have not necessarily worked in an IT based job, but at this current moment I am exploring my options and what there is to offer.
